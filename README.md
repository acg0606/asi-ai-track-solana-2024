**My knowledge before starting the project:**  
- Python Knowledge: Zero  
- Fetch.AI Agents Knowledge: Zero  
- Integration with AgentVerse and DeltaV: Zero  

**My knowledge after completing the project:**  
- Python Knowledge: Beginner  
- Fetch.AI Agents Knowledge: Intermediate  
- Integration with AgentVerse and DeltaV: Intermediate  

I completed this project on my own, feeling a bit frustrated by the lack of Brazilian participants in the AI track, but I worked hard, read through the documents, corrected GPT errors, and I believe I achieved a good result.

With no prior knowledge, I managed to code in Python. I initially struggled with local installations, only to later realize I could use AgentVerse.

I had difficulties integrating with DeltaV, but when I finally succeeded, it was an incredible moment! It was challenging, but I felt very happy to have made it work.

I finished the first version of my project in the early hours of Sunday, and I hope to refine it even more!

While it might not meet all expectations, for me, personally, it was a huge achievement!

I hope to teach others what I've learned and plan to develop more solutions using ASI agents with Solana!

Thank you for this opportunity!

Here are the details of my agent successfully published on DeltaV:  
**CheckNFT Agent**  
- agent1qdu9hgn3w3plyrs24glfefg93kmmst6yewyjajgmscqgfvd9gtc5gkxsz8g  
- fetch12xq6f67crskpqfhhvac6dppaqphz8eshf02k8h  

**Test details:**  
- Solana wallet with NFT: CMNyyCXkAQ5cfFS2zQEg6YPzd8fpHvMFbbbmUfjoPp1s  
- Solana wallet without NFT: 8sYV1s1c3sdpwkx7r66MBmRdznsDoz4wDNNoeqZJSfHs  

**My ASI wallet:**

****HOW TO TEST*****  
1. Visit the site: [DeltaV AgentVerse](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/home)  
https://deltav.agentverse.ai/home?functionGroupId=12c8601c-cccd-42de-a5f1-7eab76ae3121&_gl=1*ulhisc*_ga*MTc1NTQ2NzQ3OC4xNzI4NDgzODEw*_ga_0C55J9N0FX*MTcyODgxNjQxNi4xMC4xLjE3Mjg4MTY0MjMuMC4wLjA
2. Type "solana"  
3. Enter the address of an ASI wallet  
4. Enter the address of a Solana wallet  

The agent will search for your NFTs and present you with a list, including the count of NFTs, the value in SOL, and the total value in dollars.

**Future Roadmap:**  
In the future, I plan to integrate floor price monitoring and NFT buying and selling integrations.

Thank you so much!
